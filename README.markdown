I said, Poetify
-----------

Poetify is an open-source electronic poetry publishing platform.
It is essentially code + support. It is machinery. It is an electronic
press. 

Electropoiesis is a website. It is an instance of Poetify with an
accompanying blog and social media bits. It is the user-visible
face of Poetify.

###

Poetify ain't anything special or fancy.

The idea is to concentrate on what would be called non-ergodic texts,
texts that do not exhibit an "aesthetic of frustration".

Initially that would involve 'classical' poetic texts, re:verse texts,
and some other exemplary forms of simple text-only works.

Poetify is a collection of publishing mechanisms, released as open-source,
this is what makes it a publishing platform: because it is not devoted
to one type of text, it is reusable, it is extendable, it is shareable.

Poetify brings the spirit of Gutenberg to electronic poetry and mixes
it with the ideology of open-source.

###

Electropoiesis will be a multi-user site. It will be populated with
electronic poets. Each poet will have their own electronic poet notepad.
Each Poempad will have many ePages, as many ePages as the poet likes. Each
ePage is as long as the poet likes. Each ePage keeps a revision history
of the entire poem from inception to last breath. Each ePage is associated
with one form of text at inception. So the poet will open their Poempad
and create a new ePage of type ... whatever: classical, re:verse, and so
on.

The Poempad and ePages technology is separate from Poetify
