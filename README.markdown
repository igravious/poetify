### Welcome to Poetify

Poetify is an open-source electronic poetry publishing platform.
It is essentially code + support. It is machinery. It is an electronic
press.

Electropoiesis will be a website. It is an instance of Poetify with an
accompanying blog and social media bits. It is the user-visible
face of Poetify. There may be other instances of Poetify. That is the
nature of the beast. If this idea is to flourish then promiscuity is
the key.

### Nothing fancy schmancy

Poetify ain’t anything special or fancy. It’s just an idea whose time
has come.

The idea is to concentrate on what would be called non-ergodic texts,
on texts that do not exhibit an “aesthetic of frustration”. By this I mean
that the electronic addtions to the poetry do not impede the traditional
satisfaction that a reader gets from poetry. Poetify is not following in
any avant-garde tradition such as visual poetry, concrete poetry, hypertext
poetry or whatever flavour-du-jour is out there. In fact, you could think
of Poetify as an attempt to rein in wanton creativity and experimentation.

Initially this involves ‘classical’ poetic texts, simple textual sub-
stitution and some other exemplary forms of simple text-only works.

Styling and textual effects are of only secondary or tertiary consideration.
Likewise ‘play’.

Poetify is a collection of publishing mechanisms, released as open-source,
this is what makes it a publishing platform: because it is not devoted
to one type of text, it is reusable, it is extendable, it is shareable.

Poetify brings the spirit of Gutenberg to electronic poetry and mixes
it with the ideology of open-source.

### Electropoiesis

Electropoiesis will be a multi-user site. It will be populated with
electronic poets. Each poet will have their own electronic poet notepad.
Each Poempad will have many electronic pages (or ePages for want of a decent
shorthand), as many ePages as the poet likes. Each ePage is as long as the
poet likes, there are no page breaks because this is not the printed page.
We go back to the era of the scroll, literally. Everything old is new again.
Each ePage keeps a revision history of the entire poem from inception to last
breath. Each ePage is associated with one form of text at inception. So the
poet will open their Poempad and create a new ePage of type ... whatever:
classical, re:verse, trace:verse and so on.
